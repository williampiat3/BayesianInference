    "# Introduction to Bayesian Inference\n",
    "in this jupyter notebook our goal is to present the basic of bayesian inference and to see how we can apply it to different situations. This notebook contains a small introduction to bayesian inference, however I still have a lot to learn in the field so this presentation is also, for me, to make sure that I understood the principles\n",
